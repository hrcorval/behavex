Version History
===============================================================================

Version: 4.0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added the 'worker_id' context.config.userdata parameter to allow users to identify which worker is executing every feature or scenario when running tests in parallel. `PR #121 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/pull/121>`_

CONTRIBUTIONS:

* Contributions from `JackHerRrer <https://github.com/JackHerRrer>`__, by providing the implementation to include the 'worker_id' context.config.userdata parameter (Thanks JackHerRrer!!)


Version: 4.0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

* Changed core implementation to use **concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor** for parallel executions, avoiding crashes when a test scenario fails. `Issue #114 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/issues/114>`_
* Added information popup in HTML report, containing parallel execution settings and execution times (start time, end time, total time and scenarios duration).
* Displayed "Untested" scenarios in the HTML report.
* Updated progress bar to create a new line after completion.
* Included ENVIRONMENT_DETAILS environment variable to enable users to provide environment information in JSON and HTML reports.

FIXES:

* Fixed HTML report generation issue when running in parallel and a scenario crashed, causing BehaveX to hang.
* Updated JUnit reports to mark unexpectedly crashed scenarios as "failed" instead of "skipped".
* Corrected parallel execution summary to report the number of skipped scenarios accurately.
* Fixed progress bar issue when running tests in parallel by feature.
* Fixed issue when processing scenario tags, to always consider the tags associated with the scenario outline examples.

CONTRIBUTIONS:

* Contributions from `Zoran Lazarevic <https://github.com/lazareviczoran>`__, `Simon Sawert <https://github.com/bombsimon>`__, `Jonathan Bridger <https://github.com/jbridger>`__ for reporting and providing a solution to `Issue #114 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/issues/114>`_.

* Enhancement in HTML Report to add feature tags to scenarios
* Contribution from `Axel Furlan <https://github.com/AxelFurlanF>`__ by fixing deprecation warning when using latest Behave version (1.2.6)  `PR 116 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/pull/116>`_  (Thanks Axel!!)

FIXES:

* Fixed console summary, to properly report the number of scenarios executed
* Fix done when executing features in parallel, as not all features where considered for execution
* Fixed JUnit reports to properly report all executed scenarios (as some of them were missing)

Version: 3.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

* Enable Behavex to execute features located in different paths (behavex <features_path1> <features_path2> ... <features_pathN>)
* Printing the HTML output report path in the console at the end of the test execution
* Printing the paths where the features are located when behavex execution is started  `Issue #88 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/issues/88>`_
* Printing the execution summary when running tests in parallel
* Major improvement done to enable re-executing all failing scenarios in parallel
* Enable scenario outlines to be executed in parallel (running the outline examples in parallel)
* HTML Report layout improvements to properly render long gherkin steps and long failure messages.  `Issue #81 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/issues/81>`_
* Improvement done when parallel execution cannot be launched due to duplicated scenario names, by throwing an error exit code  `Issue #86 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/issues/86>`_

FIXES:

* Fix done when logging exceptions in environment.py module
* Fix done when processing the tags associated to scenario outline examples.  `Issue #85 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/issues/85>`_
* Fix done to detect and process scenarios written in different languages (Scenario detection does not work for Non-English languages). `Issue #77 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/issues/77>`_
* Fix done to properly render step.text in HTML report. `Issue #79 <https://github.com/hrcorval/behavex/issues/79>`_
* Fix done when parsing empty feature files.

CONTRIBUTORS:

* Contribution from `seb <https://github.com/sebns>`__ providing the fix to an issue when parsing tags associated to scenario outline examples (Thanks!!)

Version: 2.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENHANCEMENTS:

* Enabling Behavex to execute features located in a different path by specifying the Features Path (Behavex <features_path>)
* Displaying the number of features in the "Feature" column
* Showing the number of unique steps and total step executions in the "Steps" chart

FIXES:

* Fix implemented when parsing scenario outlines containing names in examples
* Adding missing webhooks related to tags (before_tag and after_tag)

Version: 1.6.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improvement in the order in which the events are executed in environment.py. On every "before_<something>" event, the BehaveX event has precedence over the same event in testing solution, and the other way around should be on every "after_<something>" event
* Reusing FEATURES_PATH environment variable to indicate were features are located

FIXES:

* Fix implemented when scenarios are dynamically skipped or removed from the execution list
* Fix implemented in scenario outlines, as scenarios were not being published in execution reports when examples are part of scenario descriptions and contain white spaces

Version: 1.5.12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Reporting the average reusability of test steps in metrics
* Consider not only the scenario description but also the feature description when creating the evidence path, to avoid issues with duplicated scenario names
* Improvement done in HTML report to consider line breaks in reported error messages in failing steps

FIXES:

* Fixed issue when executing scenarios using the "--include" argument


Version: 1.5.11
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Enable wrapper execution using the **main** method instead of the **behavex** executable: **"python -m behavex -t /<tag/> ..."**

Version: 1.5.10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Changes done to **rerun-failures** argument, to request the **failing_scenarios.txt** path as argument value

FIXES:

* Enable re-executing failing scenarios that contain blank spaces in path or filename


Version: 1.5.9
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXES:

* Another encoding fix applied to the HTML report to avoid breaking it on failing scenarios

NOTES:

* We apologize for all the previous versions that were generated in such a short period of  time. We have been working on including all requests from BehaveX users, and we were missing some of them (so we created new versions), and we did some mistakes in the meantime. We will organize to make it better next time

CONTRIBUTIONS:

* Contribution from `Ravi Salunkhe <https://github.com/salunkhe-ravi>`__ about sample project that instances the BehaveX wrapper: https://github.com/salunkhe-ravi/behavex-boilerplate-framework (Thanks Ravi!!)


Version: 1.5.8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXES:

* Adding pending encoding fix to leave everything up and running smoothly

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXES:

* Reverting back implementation to normalize scenario names to be backward compatible
* Fixing additional encoding issues reported by customers


Version: 1.5.6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXES:

* Fixing side efect with "--rerun-failures (or -rf)" argument that was not considered in local tests


Version: 1.5.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Small refactoring over the "--rerun-failures (or -rf)" argument functionality, to store the file with failures into the root folder instead of the output folder, avoiding the file to get deleted after a re-execution.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Adding documentation to re-execute failing scenarios.

Version: 1.5.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Fixed issue with scenario outlines containing quotes in description (scenario name not properly parsed)
